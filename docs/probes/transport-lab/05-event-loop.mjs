/**
 * DOES FILE I/O BLOCK THE EVENT LOOP? (v2 — an instrument that can prove itself)
 *
 * WHY v1 WAS REJECTED BY ITS OWN GUARD
 *   v1 reported the deliberately blocking `readFileSync` as showing NO lag, which
 *   the verdict correctly flagged as "instrument cannot detect blocking". Two
 *   causes, both fixed here:
 *
 *     1. THE FILE WAS IN PAGE CACHE. 256 MiB "read" in 109 ms = 2.35 GB/s, which
 *        is RAM speed. The blocking call was therefore only ~100 ms of CPU copy,
 *        easy to miss between 5 ms samples. The payload is now large enough and
 *        the cache is dropped where the OS allows it, so the control really does
 *        stall.
 *     2. THE PROBE ITSELF WAS NOISY. `setInterval` lag measured 10.3 ms on an
 *        IDLE process — worse than the reads being accused. A chained
 *        `setTimeout` measures lateness without interval drift, and the idle
 *        floor is reported FIRST so every other row is read against it.
 *
 * THE QUESTION THIS SETTLES
 *   Measured here: disk ~2.4 GB/s, loopback network ~0.2 GB/s — the disk is ~10x
 *   faster. That tempts "no thread pool needed". The conclusion is only safe if
 *   the async file APIs do not BLOCK: a blocked event loop costs far more than
 *   slow I/O, because every RPC, timer and event stops with it.
 *
 * WHAT "BLOCKED" MEANS HERE
 *   The lag distribution is compared against the IDLE floor, not against zero,
 *   and the work duration is reported alongside. A stall comparable to the work
 *   duration means the loop was unavailable for the whole operation.
 *
 * Usage: node|bun 05-event-loop.mjs [--sizeMiB=1024]
