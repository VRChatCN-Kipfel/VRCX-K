# REAL-NAME acceptance run for issue #41 — the declared scheme on real hardware, with NO
# patching of any kind.
#
# ⚠ What makes this different from `run-real-app.sh`: that one patches a scratch tree (a
# throwaway scheme + a temporary logging consumer) to prove the MECHANISM. This one runs the
# committed tree — `tauri.conf.json` declares `vrcxk`, and the host's own `ctx.deepLink` logs
# every activation — so what it measures is production wiring.
#
# ⚠ It needs a tree with BOTH halves (the shell's declaration/queue AND the host's consumer).
# Running it against the shell branch alone produces a FALSE FAILURE: the URL is delivered but
# nothing on the host side logs it, because the consumer lives in the other PR. That mistake
# cost a full diagnosis round — see `FINDINGS.md` §6.
#
# Cases:
#   1. the built bundle declares the scheme and LaunchServices claims it;
#   2. COLD START — the app is NOT running; `vrcxk://…` is what launches it;
#   3. WARM — the app is running; a second URL arrives.
# The assertion is always on the APP side (the host log), never on `open`'s exit status.
#
# Measured 2026-09-28, macOS 26.6.2 arm64. See FINDINGS.md §6 for the raw output, including the
# cold-start defect this run exposed and the fix that made it pass.
