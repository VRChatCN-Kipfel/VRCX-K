/**
 * Pin the capability INVENTORY against the RUNNING host.

 * of the same list, with better intentions.
 *
 * This boots the real services the way `host/src/index.ts` does and asserts every
 * declared service is actually retrievable from the context. If someone renames
 * or drops a service, the inventory stops matching and this fails — rather than a
 * plugin later discovering that a capability it declared cannot be resolved.

    // The first version was `getOwnPropertyNames(...).filter(in HANDS_PRIMITIVES)` compared
    // to the inventory. That is **one-directional**: because the filter discards everything
    // not already in the list, a `hands.delete()` added to the service would be filtered
    // out and the test would stay green — so the "single source of truth" claim went
    // unenforced in the direction that matters most (a NEW capability becoming reachable
    // without a manifest grant key).
    //
    // Wiring methods are legitimately not primitives, but they must be named EXPLICITLY
    // rather than dropped by a filter, so that adding a method fails this test until
    // someone decides which bucket it belongs in.
    //
    // ⚠ This list caught two REAL findings when it was first tightened:
    //   · `api` — a `private get` returning the RAW bridge API. Reachable at runtime
    //     (accessors live on the prototype and fire through the Cordis per-caller shadow),
    //     and reaching it skips `record()`: no `[cap]` audit line, no `#24` warning.
    //     Now a module-level `rawApi()`; see `hands.ts`.
    //   · `record` — likewise reachable, and worse: a plugin could call it to WRITE
    //     arbitrary `[cap]` lines into the audit log. Now module-level `record()`.
    // `guarded`/`registerGuard` stay as members on purpose: they are not an escalation (a
    // plugin can already do the same with `ctx.effect`) and the `private` modifier would
    // only imply a boundary that does not exist.
