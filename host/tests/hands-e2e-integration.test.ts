// END-TO-END: the host's `HandsService` against the REAL Rust peer, over REAL pipes.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (the gap it closes)
//   Every other hands test stops one layer short of the seam:
//
//     - `docs/probes/hands-e2e/run.mjs` drives the real Rust peer, but with a
//       hand-rolled script on the JS side (never `HandsService`).
//     - `host/tests/hands-service.test.ts` drives the real `HandsService`, but
//       against a FAKE bridge (never the real peer).
//
//   So "the host's service can talk to the shipped Rust code" was never
//   executed. That is exactly the class of gap this repo keeps getting bitten
//   by: both halves verified, the seam not. The macOS watch bug (a path-form
//   mismatch that only CI's other target could see) is the same shape.
//
// HOW IT WORKS WITHOUT A TAURI APP
//   `hands-e2e` compiles `src-tauri/src/hands.rs` and `kkrpc_peer.rs` by `#[path]`
//   — the production files, not copies — and registers the real handlers. It
//   needs no `AppHandle`, because the file primitives genuinely have no Tauri
//   dependency (unlike tray/shortcut/dialog). So a real child process on real
//   pipes IS the production code path for these four primitives.
//
//   The test spawns that binary and wraps its stdio with the same
//   `stdioJsonTransport` production uses (`connectShellStdio`'s default), then
//   drives `HandsService` through it.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT COVER
//   The Rust SHELL (the Tauri app) itself: it needs a webview and cannot run
//   headless. So the shell's own registration call (`host.rs` →
//   `register_hands_handlers`) is not exercised here — only that the module it
//   calls works with the host service on the other end.
//
// Runs only when the probe binary exists (built by
// `cargo build --release --manifest-path docs/probes/hands-e2e/rust/Cargo.toml`).
// Absence is a SKIP with a reason, never a silent pass.
