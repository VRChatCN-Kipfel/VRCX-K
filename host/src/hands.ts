// Host-side file capability: `ctx.hands` (M2 能力面).
//
// WHY THIS IS A SERVICE AND NOT A RAW MIRROR
//   `hands.stat/read/write/watch` are reachable directly through `ctx.shell`, but
//   every stream they open must be (a) attributable and (b) stopped when its
//   caller goes away. Neither is expressible on the raw wire mirror, so the
//   curated service exists for exactly those two jobs plus base64 decoding.
//
// THE TWO MEASURED RULES THIS FILE IMPLEMENTS (docs/hands-host-design.md §3-4)
//
//   1. **A stream outlives its caller unless something stops it.** Measured: a
//      stream with no guard kept producing chunks after its plugin was unloaded
//      (`docs/probes/probe-host-stream-leak.ts` — 16 chunks after unload). A plain
//      `AsyncIterable` is invisible to cordis, so the guard is explicit.
//
//   2. **The guard is `this.ctx.effect(...)`, and its registration must be
//      RELEASED when the stream ends.** `this.ctx` inside a Service method is the
//      CALLER's ctx (cordis findings §1.3), so one line covers both cases: a
//      plugin call lands on the plugin's fiber (stopped at unload), a host call
//      lands on the root ctx (stopped by `gracefulStop` step 3). But an unreleased
//      registration accumulates — measured: 1000 of them survived to unload
//      (`docs/probes/probe-host-effect-economy.ts`), so a bulk sync would build a
//      table as large as the file count.
//
//   Cost of the guard, measured: ~7.4 us per stream, ONE registration per stream
//   (`docs/probes/probe-host-option-a-cost.ts`). Negligible beside a round trip.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO
//   - No directory walking, batching or retry: those are brain-side policy
//     (proposal §1). The measured per-file cost is a full RTT.
//   - No hard permission enforcement: `#24` (M2-8) is declare-and-warn only.
//     This is NOT a security boundary — an in-process plugin can `import fs`.
