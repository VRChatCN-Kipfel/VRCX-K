/**
 * The capability inventory — ONE list, derived from what the host actually
 * provides, so a plugin's declaration can be checked against reality.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *   Two separate things were drifting towards their own private copies of the
 *   same list:
 *
 *     1. the manifest contract, whose `permissions` object enumerates the
 *        capability keys a plugin may request, and
 *     2. the runtime, where those capabilities are created across
 *        `capability.ts` (shell + four curated services), `tray.ts`, `shortcut.ts`
 *        and `index.ts` (signal).
 *
 *   A schema enum that is a hand-written copy of a runtime list will eventually
 *   disagree with it — at which point a plugin cannot request a capability that
 *   exists, or can request one that does not. That is the same "second source of
 *   truth" failure this project keeps removing, so the list lives here and both
 *   sides reference it.
 *
 *   The `permissions` contract test asserts every key below is still present in
 *   the schema, and `capability-surfaces.test.ts` asserts every key is really
 *   provided at runtime. Add a capability here only when the host provides it.
