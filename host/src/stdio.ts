/**
 * The host's stdio transport — the upstream one, unmodified.
 *
 * kkrpc's `nodeStdioTransport()` uses `process.stdin` directly as the readable
 * and auto-wires `lifecycle` to it. That is the whole point: `RPCChannel`
 * subscribes internally (`readable.on("data")`), which is what resumes stdin,
 * and only a flowing stdin emits `end`/`close` — so `onClose` actually fires.
 *
 * Why the previous hand-rolled shape could never deliver `onClose` (measured
 * exhaustively; see `docs/probes/stdio-lifecycle/FINDINGS.md`):
 *
 *   1. `lifecycle` alone never unpauses stdin. `process.stdin` is a paused
 *      `ReadStream`; `on("end")`/`on("close")`/`on("error")` — exactly what
 *      kkrpc's `lifecycle` attaches — leave `readableFlowing === null`. Only
 *      `on("data")` resumes it, and a paused stdin never emits end/close.
 *   2. Holding `Bun.stdin.stream().getReader()` locks the SAME native readable
 *      (`process.stdin !== Bun.stdin.stream()`, but coupled natively), so every
 *      rescue route — including `process.stdin.resume()` — THROWS
 *      `ERR_INVALID_STATE: ReadableStream is locked`.
 *
 * Do NOT reintroduce a `Bun.stdin.stream()` reader here. `watchStdinClose()` in
 * stdin-watch.ts takes that reader for the shell-less case, and the two are
 * mutually exclusive in BOTH orderings (measured).
 *
 * ASYMMETRY worth knowing before reading `connectShellStdio`: this transport
 * takes stdin's reader UNCONDITIONALLY once constructed — `RPCChannel`
 * subscribes on construction, and that subscription (`readable.on("data")`) is
 * precisely what puts stdin into flowing mode at all. Only the STOP is gated, on
 * `stdinIsPeerChannel()`. So a `VRCXK_SHELL=1` host whose fd 0 is not a pipe
 * (the null device, a TTY, a redirected file) still has no self-stop path: the
 * transport holds the reader and nothing acts on the close. That is unchanged
 * from before this transport swap — the old pump's `onDone` sat behind the
 * identical guard — so it is a pre-existing limitation, not a regression. It is
 * simply sharper now that the reader is always taken.
 *
 * The transport's `onClose` is wired to the stop path in `connectShellStdio`.
 * It first REJECTS every pending request (`handleTransportClose`), which is why
 * `bootstrap` treats a failed `shell.ready` as an expected outcome rather than a
 * fatal error — see the comment there.
 */

/**
 * A transport that RECORDS write failures and otherwise behaves identically.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: kkrpc reports "the peer is gone" through two independent
 * paths, and the official transport only surfaces the first:
 *
 *   1. the read side ends  -> `handleTransportClose` rejects pending calls with
 *      `RPCTransportClosedError`, and `onClose` fires (probe 15, cells A–D);
 *   2. a WRITE fails (EPIPE) -> `handleWriteFailure` rejects the matching call
 *      with the raw write error, and `onClose` does NOT fire, because the read
 *      side is still healthy and nothing ended it (probe 16, cell E — measured).
 *
 * Case 2 is the same physical event seen from the sending side, and it is the
 * one that matters at startup: `ready` is the FIRST frame the host writes, so a
 * shell that dies just before/while we announce ourselves can only be noticed
 * this way.
 *
 * The observer is deliberately PASSIVE: it re-throws unchanged, so kkrpc still
 * rejects the pending call and the existing control flow is untouched. Swallowing
 * the error here would convert a fast failure into a 30-second timeout, which is
 * strictly worse. Verified: the call still rejects with the same plain Error and
 * a healthy transport records nothing (probe 18).
 *
 * Detecting EPIPE is safe to read as "peer gone": a write to a pipe whose reader
 * is alive-but-idle blocks or buffers rather than failing, so the error only
 * appears once every read end is closed (measured — probe 18).
